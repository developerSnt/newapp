        "title": "Tesla Solar Roof Review: A Sleek Look at a Stiff Price",
        "text": "Tesla is best known for its electric cars but has also become one of the largest solar panel installers in the US. However, one of Tesla's newest solar innovations, the Tesla Solar Roof provides an alternative way to get solar on your roof, by making solar part of your roof. While it doesn't quite look like a regular roof, Tesla's Solar Roof is definitely more discreet than traditional rooftop solar panels. If you're bothered by the look of solar panels on your roof (and are replacing your roof anyway), the Solar Roof is a solution. But it comes with a huge price tag. You can get the same solar power production for far less money, even when you factor in the cost of a new roof. Tesla no longer runs a press office, so the information below is limited to what's publicly available online. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment sent to its still-listed press email. And while we researched Tesla's Solar Roof to the best of our ability, we did not test it in any hands-on or empirical way. Solar products are difficult to review in the traditional sense. Whenever possible, get multiple quotes from multiple installers, including those local to your area. What do I get from a Tesla Solar Roof? Tesla pitches the Solar Roof as a breakthrough of technology and design. And while it's not the first time someone has incorporated solar power into a building's design, the Solar Roof is one of the highest-profile instances. It's also one of the better solar roof products we've looked at. A solar roof is essentially a roof made up of mini solar panels that look and function like traditional roof shingles. So when you order a Tesla Solar Roof, you aren't getting regular solar panels to put on your roof, you're getting a new roof made of regular and photovoltaic shingles. Not every shingle on your roof is going to be a \"solar shingle\" -- it'll be a mix of solar and regular shingles. The result is a covering that powers your house and keeps you dry all while looking like a normal roof to the average passerby. But this means scrapping your current roof. While Tesla has recently said it will install Solar Roofs on top of newer, single-layer roofs of some designs, most roofs will have to be replaced to install the Tesla Solar Roof. Tesla also requires the installation of at least one Tesla Powerwall battery with the Solar Roof. Warranties Your Tesla Solar Roof is well covered by three warranties. You'll get a 25-year product warranty, a 25-year weatherization warranty and a 25-year performance warranty. Of the few solar shingle manufacturers on the market, Tesla offers the best solar shingle warranties. No other solar roof company we've found offers a 25-year weatherization warranty. And while other companies offer 25-year performance warranties, we found Tesla's to be a bit stronger. Wattage Every individual solar shingle comes with a wattage rating, showing how much power each solar shingle can output under ideal conditions. The wattage of your solar roof determines how much power your roof will be able to generate. One of Tesla's solar shingles is 71.67 watts, which isn't too bad in comparison to other solar shingle products available. But what you should really pay attention to is its wattage per square foot, which is a measure of how much power you'll be able to generate within a specific amount of space. The higher a shingle's wattage per square foot, the less roof space is required to meet your power needs. And you might save some money since you'll be installing fewer shingles. Tesla's solar shingles generate about 15.3 watts per square foot -- not the best, but certainly not the worst. Wind rating Every brand of solar shingle comes with a wind rating, telling you what wind speeds your solar roof will be able to withstand. The Tesla Solar Roof can withstand wind speeds of up to 110 mph. This is lower than what other solar roof manufacturers offer. The most common solar shingle wind rating we found is 130 mph, with the highest we found being 200 mph. While Tesla's wind rating is lower than competing brands, we still wouldn't necessarily call it bad. But if you live somewhere prone to extreme weather, a solar roof with a higher wind rating might be a better option. Tesla Powerwall If you decide to install the Tesla Solar Roof, you'll also have to purchase at least one of Tesla's Powerwall batteries. Tesla has three Powerwall battery models: the Powerwall 2, Powerwall Plus and Powerwall 3. When it comes to specs, all three batteries are pretty similar. The Tesla Powerwall 3 is Tesla's newest battery, offering the same energy storage capacity as the other Powerwall models, but with over twice the power output. Both the Powerwall 2 and Powerwall Plus batteries are currently still available. However, Tesla could discontinue production of these particular battery models in the future. Every Tesla Powerwall model is covered under the same warranty, and it's actually pretty good. It's a 10-year, unlimited cycle warranty. This means there's no limit on the amount times you can drain and recharge your battery while it's under warranty. The warranty also includes a guarantee that your battery will still be able to retain at least 70% of its original maximum capacity by the time your warranty expires. How much does a Tesla Solar Roof cost? Compared to other solar panel installations, a Solar Roof will be pricier. The price may be more or less justifiable depending on the condition of your current roof. If you're due for a new roof, you'll be writing a large check for that anyway. If your goal is to generate solar for the least amount of money possible, a Solar Roof isn't for you. Tesla's online estimate for a house in Dallas offered 10.37 kilowatts of solar generation and one Powerwall battery for $58,182. Tesla estimates 10.37 kilowatts of solar and two Powerwalls at the same location will cost around $63,152. It's also important to note that these prices factor in incentives, like the federal solar tax credit. Another factor that could alter the price of your system is the complexity of your roof. Steep pitches, multiple levels and a lot of obstructions could drive up the cost. The map below shows the average prices for residential solar panel installations as reported by FindEnergy.com. The cost of solar shingles/roofs are not included in this data set. State incentives and the tax credit are not included in the estimate either. States in gray don't have data available. Is Tesla's Solar Roof a good deal? As with every major purchase, it's important to shop around. This is especially true of solar systems, where a local provider might beat national solar companies, which often have higher overhead costs. Tesla has made its solar panel installations cheaper, though the Solar Roof doesn't have any one-to-one comparisons. If you hate the look of solar panels or love the look of the Solar Roof, it might be the right choice for you. You will have to pay a premium, though how much depends on the condition and layout of your roof. While the Solar Roof is an exciting product, it isn't practical for most people. With a Solar Roof, you'll get quality equipment backed by strong warranties, but another company may offer a greater choice among panels, batteries and inverters (including some of those that Tesla offers) at a much lower price. And, there are online concerns about Tesla's customer service (more on that below). Other companies have rolled out their own solar shingle products, notably GAF Energy, earlier this year. While GAF prices aren't public, in January a spokesperson said the cost would be about half of Tesla's Solar Roof. More recently GAF said a new roof with solar shingles will cost about the same as a new roof and solar panels. Its solar shingles look less like a regular roof than Tesla's, however. Tesla's solar panel side of its energy business has a reputation online for poor customer service. There aren't any reliable, public sources of customer service for the solar industry at this point, however. Online testimonials show that Tesla's solar panel customer service was bad enough to make some people regret their choice, though others were happy to save money on Tesla's cheap panel installations and put up with the service. If customer service for Solar Roofs is similarly bad, it's even harder to accept the cost. Because there are fewer Solar Roof customers, it's hard to get any kind of read on how customer service might differ. There is the chance that, as Tesla tries to increase installations of Solar Roofs while its share of the solar panel market shrinks, it values customer service more for Solar Roof customers (though this is all speculation). Does Tesla operate in my state? How do I order? Tesla operates in all 50 states. The best way to find out if you're in Tesla's service area is to go to the company's site to enter your address for an estimate. Tesla reportedly has expanded its service area for the Solar Roof to the entire US, though some addresses still say they're unavailable when you request an estimate. Tesla is definitely expanding, however, through the use of third-party contractors. In some areas, Tesla will refer you to the website or contact information of a certified installer instead of giving you an estimate. To order through Tesla, create an account online. Tesla then uses satellite imagery of your roof to design a system and price estimate, which will be finalized when an Tesla agent visits your home to confirm the roof complexity, size and a few other details. After you and Tesla agree on a design, it will pull permits and put you on the schedule to install. Tesla reportedly has some in-house teams, even while bringing on more third-party installers. Tesla Solar reviews: What are customers saying? Reading online customer reviews provides a great starting place when trying to gauge which company has better service. And while these reviews shouldn't be taken as gospel, they can give you a good idea about the kind of customer experience you might receive. In Tesla's case, it's a bit of a mixed bag. We've pulled a small sample of positive and negative reviews from Tesla Solar's Better Business Bureau and Trustpilot pages. These reviews have been lightly edited for spelling and grammar. 5 star reviews \"My entire experience with Tesla Energy Solar was seamless. I honestly give all that credit to [the salesperson]. He was very patient with all my questions. He walked me through every single step and followed through on all elements. I received several quotes from other companies and was ignored by others. I would without a doubt recommend Tesla Solar Energy and [the salesperson]!\" Rosa G. February 22, 2023 \"A neighbor referred me to this firm as I had no idea where to start. Being retired, I was concerned about saving money in the now. The system that was built for me was able to save me 50% on my monthly electricity costs. Every dollar counts at my age, so I am more than happy to accept those savings.\" Amirat N. August 8, 2022 1 star reviews \"We love Tesla cars and the philosophy. We made a HUGE mistake in extending that trust to the solar energy unit. It has been the single worst customer experience we've had in fifty years. Buy the cars. Whatever you do, don't order their solar system or you will go months and months awaiting the smallest inevitable repair.\" Owen W. August 10, 2023 \"The only thing worse than Tesla service centers is the service you get from Tesla Energy. Tesla told us our system would take three days to install. After not showing up for 15 to 20 appointments, the system took 35 days to install. The system never worked the way it should. It is underproducing massively compared to what Tesla said it would. Tesla doesn't monitor the system much at all. They installed inverters that were already so out of date that they needed to upgrade motherboards after the installation. One of my inverters stopped working later, and it takes a month or more to get Tesla to show up to fix the issue.\" Adam July 4, 2023 How we evaluated the best solar shingles Frequently asked questions",

        "title": "Elon Musk $45 Billion Pay Package Battle Could Slow Tesla's Growth",
        "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 13: Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and X, speaks to reporters as he leaves the ... [+] “AI Insight Forum” at the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on September 13, 2023 in Washington, DC. Lawmakers are seeking input from business leaders in the artificial intelligence sector, and some of their most ardent opponents, for writing legislation governing the rapidly evolving technology. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Getty Images Tesla’s stock market value has fallen 52% since peaking in November 2021 at $1.2 trillion — a stunning loss of $620 billion in market capitalization, according to the New York Times. On June 13, CEO Elon Musk got a vote of support from Tesla shareholders for his $45 billion pay package, noted the Times. Does this vote mean Musk gets the extra $45 billion in Tesla stock options so he can top out his net worth at $200 billion? What does this shareholder vote mean for people who own Tesla stock? The short answer to these questions is: “No and possibly nothing.” How so? The Delaware ruling that struck down Musk’s pay package still stands and more litigation is likely ahead, noted the Times. Tesla’s stock has fallen due to the company’s disappointing performance and prospects. This vote does not change Musk’s relatively uncompelling strategy to boost growth, about which I wrote in an April Forbes post. Musk expressed elation about the vote. After the results of Tesla’s shareholder vote were announced he “appeared on stage dancing and thanking shareholders: ‘I just want to start out by saying, ‘Hot damn, I love you guys,’ ” reported the Wall Street Journal. Tesla’s Shareholder Vote On Musk’s Pay On June 13, Tesla shareholders “reaffirmed a pay award of more than $45 billion” for Musk at Tesla’s annual meeting in Austin, Tex., noted the Times. MORE FOR YOU Does Inside Out 2 Have An End Credits Scene NYT Strands Hints Spangram And Answers For Friday June 14 Connor McGregor s Return Fight Canceled Over Injury Meaning Pereira Vs Prochazka Will Headline UFC 303 Tesla’s board had called for the vote following the January 2024 ruling by a judge in Delaware — where Tesla is registered — striking down Musk’s 2018 pay package. The package gave Musk “stock options worth tens of billions of dollars if he hit demanding revenue or profit benchmarks and increased the company’s stock value to $650 billion,” noted the Times. Tesla’s business improved after the 2018 approval of Musk’s pay package. That year Tesla was scrambling to produce its lower-priced Model 3 sedan. Tesla’s business grew rapidly soon after the approval. The company’s market capitalization topped the package’s $650 billion target long enough for Musk to collect his options, the Times reported. . At the start of 2024, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Court of Chancery in Delaware, “agreed with a group of disenchanted Tesla shareholders who contended in a lawsuit that the 2018 pay package was wildly excessive,” the Journal wrote. McCormick ruled the 2018 pact was “tainted by the board’s failure to disclose conflicts of interest stemming from their personal and financial ties to Musk,” according the Journal. Tesla’s Lowered Growth Expectations Tesla’s stock has not done well this year. Tesla’s stock price has fallen 24% while the S&P 500 rose 14%, noted the Times. Tesla declining stock seems to be due to disappointing performance and prospects. As I wrote in early April, Tesla stock was falling for three reasons: Tesla delivered far fewer vehicles than expected and forecasts more disappointment. Tesla appeared hesitant about winning over value-sensitive buyers — leaving that segment of the market to lower-priced rivals such as BYD. Tesla’s pivot to Robotaxis has little chance of restoring revenue growth. On April 23, Tesla reported terrible earnings and the stock soared. For example, in Tesla’s first quarter, revenue fell 9%; net income was down 55%, and the company’s free cash flow was negative $2.5 billion. What’s more, Tesla told investors its volume growth rate “may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023,” I noted in April. Since then Tesla’s stock has risen 28%. Why did the stock rise? In its April 23 investor presentation, Tesla hinted at launching more affordable models by 2025 on its existing manufacturing lines. The company also retreated from plans to produce a new vehicle priced below $25,000 in new facilities. In addition, Musk told investors Tesla “should be thought of as an AI robotics company,” Reuters reported. It is unclear whether or when these announcements will translate into higher revenues and profits for Tesla or if they will become another of Musk’s unrealized hopes. A case in point among many is Tesla’s Cybertruck — which launched to much hype in November 2023 only to suffer an April 2024 recall of 3,878 of the vehicles “to repair or replace faulty accelerator pedals,” noted the Journal. What’s Next For Musk’s Pay? Musk’s big pay package has not been reinstated. It is unclear whether the shareholder vote will alter his commitment to Tesla. After the vote, Musk told shareholders the pay package “is not actually cash, and I can’t cut and run, nor would I want to,” the Times wrote. What would it take for Musk to get his $45 billion? Tesla wants the Delaware court to reverse its ruling on his pay package and has “vowed to appeal the decision,” the Times reported. Tesla expressed hope in an April regulatory filing that shareholder ratification would “resolve concerns raised by the court, including that Tesla failed to adequately disclose important details of the package to investors,” noted the Times. Tesla might also be able to use a provision of Delaware law to ratify the pay package. Delaware’s Section 204 “allows companies to correct defective corporate actions,” the Journal reported. Since this section is generally used to address “improper documentation,” applying that legal tactic might be a stretch for Tesla. Will Tesla Stock Rise Further? Following the shareholder vote in favor of Musk’s pay package, Tesla stock rose. Bernstein estimated diluted earnings per share would rise about 10% if Musk’s stock options were canceled, the Journal reported. Clearly something else moved up Tesla stock — which could be investors’ perception that the shareholder vote increases the odds of Musk spending more time on Tesla. However, with Musk telling Tesla’s annual general meeting he is tired of cutting costs, according to the Journal, he may not be right person to lead the company in the face of rivalry from lower cost producers such as BYD. If you think Tesla needs to get out of the EV market and move into less rivalrous waters, Musk could be good for the stock. Indeed at the AGM, Musk said Tesla’s market capitalization could reach $5 trillion once the company “solves self-driving robotaxis” and “$25 trillion once it has also mastered humanoid robots,” the Journal reported. Wall Street sees Tesla stock as over-valued. Specifically, the average Tesla price target is $172.92 — making the stock 3.4% too high — based on 32 Wall Street analysts offering 12-month price targets, according to TipRanks. While Tesla shareholders’ vote in favor of Musk’s pay makes him feel good, investors would be better off buying a low cost S&P 500 index fund. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

        "title": "‘Elon Doesn’t Care About Tesla Anymore’: Musk’s Biggest Fans Are Turning On Him",
        "text": "Ahead of a shareholder vote on restoring the billionaire entrepreneur's massive stock award, Musk faces strident resistance from previously reliable sources who now question his commitment to the electric vehicle company. By Alan Ohnsman, Forbes Staff For years, Elon Musk had no greater fan than Tesla investor Ross Gerber. When he mocked the SEC on Twitter a few years ago, Gerber asked him to vent to him privately because “you’re just helping the enemy.” When Tesla’s board asked shareholders in 2018 to award Musk with stock potentially worth tens of billions of dollars, Gerber backed it, because “true shareholders are all in on Elon.” But after a year in which Musk has made increasingly controversial comments and fixated on newer endeavors, like X/Twitter and his artificial intelligence startup xAI, Gerber has had enough. The CEO of Los Angeles-based wealth manager Gerber Kawasaki has suddenly become a strident and outspoken critic of the entrepreneur he’s long admired. And with a looming shareholder vote to restore a pay package for Tesla’s CEO worth around $50 billion, he’ll be voting no — the first time he’s so publicly opposed one of the Tesla board’s recommendations. “When I voted for the package in 2018, that was based off information I had at the time and the fact that Elon worked at Tesla full time,” Gerber told Forbes. “Now my reluctance to vote for it has to do with new factors, the most important being that he doesn't work at Tesla anymore. He works for xAI and he works for X. Tesla is not his priority.” Gerber isn’t the only Tesla fan to have turned on Musk after years of devotion. Singapore-based Leo Koguan, who once described Musk as “the only person I really respect on Earth” and claims to be Tesla’s biggest retail shareholder, also voted against the board’s proposal to restore stock awards Musk was stripped of by a Delaware judge in January. “I’ve discovered Tesla has one shareholder, a one-person board and one tyrant CEO,” Koguan told Forbes. “The priority is he should work and do his job as CEO of Tesla. “I’ve discovered Tesla has one shareholder, a one-person board and one tyrant CEO” Investor Leo Koguan Musk has repeatedly pushed back on accusations he’s not focused enough on Tesla, even as the number of other companies he’s running has grown to include SpaceX, Boring Co., Neuralink, X and xAi. “I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off,” he said in a recent earnings call. “I'm going to make sure Tesla is quite prosperous. It is prosperous and it will be very much so in the future.” More staid institutional investors have also been spooked by Musk’s antics and voted against the compensation proposal, including Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, Amalgamated Bank, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), New York City Comptroller and Nordea Asset Management, as well as advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis. Along with the billionaire’s pay, the June 13 annual shareholder meeting will also put to a vote Musk’s plans to reincorporate Tesla in Texas from Delaware – where he’d moved the company to avail himself of the state’s lighter approach to business regulation – and new board terms for people close to him: his brother Kimbal and James Murdoch. Musk and bullish equity analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives and Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas expect the compensation vote to come out in his favor, based on shareholder surveys. “So far, roughly 90% of retail shareholders who have voted have voted in favor” of the resolution, Musk tweeted on June 8. “The public sentiment is unequivocally supportive.” Gerber isn’t so sure. Musk, who owns 13% of the company, “can’t vote his shares, so if you take that out, it comes down to the institutional shareholders, who are being advised to vote against it,” he said. “I’m kind of looking at the outcome as a coin flip right now.” “There’s a real sadness and disappointment that Elon really doesn’t care about Tesla anymore” Ross Gerber That the outcome isn’t a foregone conclusion suggests something of a reckoning for Musk, who has fallen in public esteem from a widely praised serial entrepreneur and cleantech visionary to a pugnacious and erratic billionaire who seems unconcerned with offending current and potential Tesla customers, regulators and even presidents, seemingly spending more time on X posting to his 187 million followers than strategizing with engineers on new models and features. The result: inflammatory tweets that are antisemitic, racist, and anti-trans and high-profile misfires like Tesla’s bulky Cybertruck. None of that helps the company’s brand as EV market competition grows more fierce. “I think across the board among all Tesla owners and shareholders, there's a real sadness and disappointment that Elon really doesn't care about Tesla anymore,” Gerber said. Tesla fell 2% to $173.79 on Monday and have declined nearly 30% this year. Unclear Future Year after year, votes on shareholder proposals at Tesla’s annual meetings have been rubber stamp affairs: initiatives the board recommended were approved; those it opposed, such as better disclosure on child labor, discrimination and environmental impacts of its global operations and sourcing, failed. But the pay vote takes place at a time when the future for the leading electric vehicle company looks less certain than it did even a year ago – and as concerns over Musk’s focus and business judgment grow. Tesla’s business in China, which fueled consistent profitability starting in 2020, is cooling and it posted dismal first-quarter results in April, with net income down 55% and a drop in sales that exceeded consensus expectations. Shortly after that, Musk shocked the markets with news that he’d inexplicably sacked most members of Tesla’s Supercharger team, a revenue bright spot as more automakers pay the company to access its extensive EV charging network. Subsequently, many members of the team were rehired, according to media reports, but the company has also faced an exodus of key leaders: Senior Vice President Drew Baglino, public policy and business development chief Rohan Patel and Rebecca Tinucci, who led the Supercharger team. Tesla electric vehicles charge beneath solar panels at a Tesla Supercharger location in Santa Monica, California. AFP via Getty Images Musk has also stopped talking about some of his long-stated goals. During Tesla’s earnings call in April, he didn’t mention his target of Tesla selling 20 million EVs globally by the end of the decade, and didn’t provide details for lower-cost electric models the market has been waiting for since he first promised them in 2006. That’s a critical issue as they’re needed to fend off increasingly tough competition from rivals like China’s BYD, which already sells EVs that are much cheaper than Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover. Instead, Musk pivoted to promoting Tesla as an AI company, talking up dramatic plans for robotaxi business and humanoid robots. But neither is likely to generate significant revenue for years, assuming the company can turn them into commercial realities. His intense embrace of AI, with xAI just raising $6 billion, also marks another flip-flop given his dire warnings about its rise starting a decade ago. After Musk bought Twitter, his stake in Tesla shrank significantly because he sold billions of dollars in stock to fund the purchase. Earlier this year, he began arguing he deserves a bigger ownership stake in Tesla because he was concerned about a takeover by “dubious” interests. “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics without having 25% voting control,” he said on X. Those dubious interests appear to include some of his formerly staunch supporters who now see such statements as evidence that Musk no longer prioritizes Tesla and has “conflicts of interest,” Koguan told Forbes. For instance, CNBC recently reported that Musk asked Nvidia to divert a shipment of highly in-demand H100 AI chips from Tesla to xAi and X. “He extorted publicly for 25% of Tesla,” Koguan said. Shareholders that approve his stock compensation “would donate more shares to his already unfathomable deep pocket.” “He extorted publicly for 25% of Tesla” Leo Koguan Company Chair Robyn Denholm is working to rally investor support for Musk’s compensation package, based on Tesla hitting various market cap and financial targets laid out in 2018, arguing that boosting his stake will help keep him motivated to prioritize the company. “The ratification of the pay package is really about fairness – fairness to our CEO,” she told CNBC last week. Her argument has been persuasive to investors, including billionaire Ron Baron, who came out in favor of the compensation plan last week. “Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla,” he said in an open letter. There’s certainly evidence that Musk’s drive was uniquely responsible for the company’s success. But his increasingly controversial behavior also appears to be hurting it. The EV company’s brand image tumbled dramatically in a recent Axios Harris 100 poll of America’s most visible companies. Tesla dropped to 63 in the survey, down from a high of eighth place in 2021. Gerber thinks things may only get worse. “The performance of the company has been so poor since he bought Twitter,” he said. “There seems to be a denial from everybody around Elon of the fact that this has affected Tesla sales – and that his antisemitic, racist belief system is harmful to Tesla's brand.” “It's like everybody there just lives in a fantasy that somehow this is all going to be okay because the magic man will come and invent some robots that will save Tesla.” MORE FROM FORBES ForbesTesla Shareholders Vote On Elon Musk's $50 Billion Pay Package Next Week-Here's What's At StakeBy Derek SaulForbesDr. Elon And Mr. Musk: Tesla's Chaotic Robotaxi PivotBy Alan OhnsmanForbesTesla's Top Retail Investor Votes Against Restoring Elon Musk's $50 Billion Pay PackageBy Alan OhnsmanForbesElon Musk Says Robotaxis Don't Need Lidar - As Tesla Buys Them From LuminarBy Alan Ohnsman Follow me on LinkedIn.

        "title": "Hiltzik: The true meaning of Tesla's shareholder votes",
        "text": "No one who has followed the career of that famously self-effacing and modest business leader Elon Musk could have expected him to boast openly about having secured approval from Tesla shareholders for two important initiatives: moving the company's state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware, and \"ratifying\" his massive 2018 compensation package after it was invalidated by a Delaware state judge. Ha ha. Just kidding. The day before the votes were formally tallied and announced after the company's annual meeting Thursday, Musk telegraphed the results on X, formerly Twitter, the social media platform he owns. Both resolutions \"are currently passing by wide margins,\" he tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \"Thanks for your support!!\" and bracketing that line with a quartet of valentine-red hearts. Thursday evening, after the votes were in, he tweeted a photo of a cake with the iced legend \"Vox Populi, Vox Dei,\" a Latin phrase meaning \"the voice of the people is the voice of the gods,\" and appending the comment, \"Sending this cake to Delaware as a parting gift.\" The Tesla board instantly executed the change of incorporation, which is evidently rooted in Musk's conviction that Texas courts, which have little experience in adjudicating corporate governance issues, will be more pliant in his hands than the very experienced Delaware judiciary. From all that, one might assume that the shareholder votes cleared the legal complexities erected around the 2018 compensation grant by Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January. That assumption may be wrong, according to several experts in corporate law. The idea that shareholders can retrospectively validate a corporate action overturned in Chancery Court is \"divorced from the realities of Delaware law,\" observed Charles M. Elson, one of he nation's recognized authorities on the topic, in a May 13 legal brief. That may not be the only issue about Tesla and Musk that is arguably divorced from reality. By many objective standards, the electric vehicle maker is in a bad way. A grim story was told by its first-quarter results, released on April 23. The company disclosed its lowest automotive profit margin, 15.9%, in five years, a major decline from its peak of about 30% in the first quarter of 2022. That reflected several rounds of price cuts to keep Tesla vehicles moving off the lots, resulting in a decline of $2.42 billion, or 13%, in auto sales during that quarter from the same quarter a year earlier. Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter, down by 8.5% from the same quarter a year earlier. That includes deliveries of its most highly touted new model, the Cybertruck pickup, which has been ridiculed in the automotive press and on social media for its risibly blockheaded design and mechanical and cosmetic flaws. Tesla faces stiffer competitive headwinds than it has encountered at any other time in its history. These are coming not only from legacy automakers that are coming to market with hybrid and fully electric models, but the Chinese EV-maker BYD, which overtook Tesla in deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023, when it sold more than 526,000 all-electric vehicles compared with Tesla's 484,510 in the same period. More troubling from Tesla's standpoint, BYD is taking steps to expand its market significantly beyond domestic drivers and into Europe and even the U.S. Tesla also faces more shareholder discontent over Musk's role in the company. In the past, his image as a technological visionary was inextricably linked with Tesla's image and the appeal of its products; a Tesla without Musk at the helm was almost unimaginable. Investor confidence in his leadership was manifest; the share price closed on Nov. 1, 2021, at $407.36, when the company's market value peaked at a stupendous $1.2 trillion. More recently, Musk's reputation has waned among significant segments of the public, thanks to the increasingly strident, partisan, reactionary and antisemitic viewpoints he has expressed on X. Investors aren't especially happy about the company's waning prospects. The shares are down by more than 54% from that peak close in 2021, by more than 33% from a year ago, and by nearly 25% year-to-date. As I write, Tesla's market value is less than $600 billion. One issue roiling the investor cadre is whether Tesla is as important to Musk as it used to be. His corporate universe includes not only X, but SpaceX and an artificial intelligence company dubbed X.AI. Musk has on occasion poached talent and resources from Tesla to benefit his other companies. The Tesla board has gone along with that, but not all investors feel so tolerant. Two individual shareholders and the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund sued over the practice on Thursday — filing the case in Delaware right under the wire before Tesla followed through on the reincorporation vote by making itself a Texas company. They say they're irked because Musk had been touting Tesla as, in his own words, \"an AI/robotics company that appears to many to be a car company\" and \"the biggest AI project on Earth.\" That's an indication that Musk wishes to capture for Tesla the superior price/earnings multiple enjoyed by high-tech and especially AI companies (at the moment) in comparison with car companies. But if he's shifting his AI efforts out of Tesla, that obviously won't wash. And he seems to be doing so. The plaintiffs observe that Musk has poached AI engineers from Tesla to work at X.AI — at least 11 former Tesla employees went over to the new company. Furthermore, according to a report by CNBC cited by the plaintiffs, Musk personally ordered Nvidia, the global leader in AI processing chips, to divert 12,000 units ordered by Tesla to X and X.AI instead, adding months to the delays in \"setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs\" to develop robots and self-driving vehicles. Even before the shareholder vote, Musk intimated by tweet that he might not be inclined to develop AI capabilities within Tesla, as opposed to at his other companies, unless the Tesla board granted him a 25% voting control of Tesla. This isn't the first time Musk has treated the companies he controls, whether private or publicly-traded, all as arms of his personal satrapy. After taking over X (then Twitter) in 2022, he brought over Tesla engineers to rework the social media platform's software. And in 2016 he orchestrated a rescue of SolarCity, his failing solar power company, by merging it with Tesla. In that case, typically, his acolytes on both boards went along without objection and, evidently, without spending much time on analysis of the deal. (I've asked Tesla to comment on all these issues, but answers came there none.) That brings us back to the compensation deal and Thursday's votes. In her 201-page decision issued on Jan. 30, Chancellor McCormick rescinded the 2018 pay package on several grounds. She found that the unprecedentedly large $56-billion package was excessive. That was especially so given the control Musk exercises over Tesla as its largest single stockholder (with 21.9% at the time of McCormick's ruling and 20.5% as of March 31) and through his personal relationships and influence over several ostensibly independent Tesla board members — relationships which, McCormick found, had not been adequately disclosed to shareholders voting on the pay package. Musk reacted to McCormick's ruling by proposing to take oversight of Tesla's government out of the Delaware Chancery Court's hands through a reincorporation in Texas. The Tesla board, which had changed somewhat since 2018 but was still supine toward Musk, also asked shareholders in effect to overturn McCormick's ruling by voting on the pay package again. In setting up the second vote, the Tesla board didn't display much more inclination to examine the pay package than it had the first time around, when the process of developing the package was all but exclusively under Musk's control. This time, the board established a special committee of two board members. But one resigned early on, and the board never replaced him. In other words, the special committee was a committee of one, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, a former executive of Walgreens and Kellogg's. According to Tesla, the committee \"did not substantively reevaluate the amount or terms\" of the 2018 package \"and did not engage a compensation consultant.\" Nor did the committee renegotiate the pay package with Musk. After all, the company said, the board had decided in 2018 that the package was \"fair\"; nothing had changed since 2018, so all that needed to happen in light of McCormick's ruling was that there be more disclosure of board relationships. Is that so? A lot has changed, obviously. To begin with, the 2018 package incorporated numerous incentive milestones that Musk would have to meet to receive any part of or even the full $56 billion. Tesla actually did reach those milestones, but what further incentives exist to keep Musk engaged into the future? Musk's threat to take his AI operations out of Tesla unless he receives more voting control obviously point to the need to keep him on board. \"Stockholders should know whether the board’s request for a vote is motivated by the threat — and what, if anything, the board plans to do about Musk’s threat if he attempts to carry it out,\" wrote corporate governance experts Lucian Bebchuk and Robert J. Jackson Jr. prior to Thursday's vote. \"Strikingly, the board hasn’t conditioned holding the vote on Musk withdrawing his threat or committing not to carry it out if stockholders vote to approve.\" They add, \"the board should recognize the influence of the sword of Damocles hanging over shareholder heads: the outcome of any stockholder vote could well be seriously distorted by Musk’s looming threat.\" The Tesla board, therefore, has once again behaved as Musk's cat's-paw. That's not surprising, since the board is nothing like truly independent. Its eight members include Musk, his brother Kimball, his longtime friends Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch (a son of Rupert Murdoch), former Tesla executive and former SolarCity board member J. B. Straubel and, as chair, Robyn M. Denholm, who testified that the wealth she has collected as a Tesla director has been \"life-changing.\" McCormick found that although Denholm didn't have a personal relationship with Musk, her dependence on Tesla almost exclusively as a source of her personal wealth might have compromised her judgment in approving the 2018 package and contributed to her \"lackadaisical approach to her oversight obligations.\" So assuming that the Delaware court won't step in again to rescind the pay package, Musk is once again getting all he wants from Tesla, with even fewer incentives to perform for the future than he has had in the past. Good for him. But if Tesla continues its recent decline in market value, its non-Musk shareholders will have no one to blame but its board, and themselves.",

        "title": "Tesla investors sue Elon Musk for diverting carmaker’s resources to xAI",
        "text": "A group of Tesla investors yesterday sued Elon Musk, the company, and its board members, alleging that Tesla was harmed by Musk's diversion of resources to his xAI venture. The diversion of resources includes hiring AI employees away from Tesla, diverting microchips from Tesla to X (formerly Twitter) and xAI, and \"xAI's use of Tesla's data to develop xAI's own software/hardware, all without compensation to Tesla,\" the lawsuit said. The lawsuit in Delaware Court of Chancery was filed by three Tesla shareholders: the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, Daniel Hazen, and Michael Giampietro. It seeks financial damages for Tesla and the disgorging of Musk's equity stake in xAI to Tesla. \"Could the CEO of Coca-Cola loyally start a competing soft-drink company on the side, then divert scarce ingredients from Coca-Cola to the startup? Could the CEO of Goldman Sachs loyally start a competing financial advisory company on the side, then hire away key bankers from Goldman Sachs to the startup? Could the board of either company loyally permit such conduct without doing anything about it? Of course not,\" the lawsuit says. Tesla and Musk have touted artificial intelligence \"as the key to Tesla's future\" and described Tesla as an AI company, the lawsuit said. By founding xAI, Musk started a competing company \"and then divert[ed] talent and resources from his corporation to the startup,\" with the apparent approval of Tesla's board, the lawsuit said. After founding xAI in March 2023, \"Musk hired away numerous key AI-focused employees from Tesla to xAI\" and later diverted Nvidia GPUs from Tesla to X and xAI, the lawsuit said. The GPU diversion was recently confirmed by Nvidia emails that were revealed in a report by CNBC. GPU diversion Before founding xAI, \"Musk stated that Tesla needed more Nvidia H100 GPUs than Nvidia had available for sale, a common problem in the AI industry... After Musk established xAI, however, he began personally directing Nvidia to redirect GPUs from Tesla to xAI and X,\" the lawsuit said. The investors suing Musk and Tesla don't buy Musk's justification. \"For his part, Musk dubiously claimed in a post on X following the publication of the CNBC report that, contrary to his prior public representations about Tesla's appetite for Nvidia hardware, 'Tesla had no place to send the Nvidia chips to turn them on, so they would have just sat in a warehouse,'\" the lawsuit said. The complaint says that a pitch deck to potential investors in xAI said the new firm \"intended to harvest data from X and Tesla to help xAI catch up to AI companies OpenAI and Anthropic. X would provide data from social media users, and Tesla would provide video data from its cars.\" \"It is apparent that Musk has pitched prospective investors in xAI partly by exploiting information owned by Tesla,\" the lawsuit also said. \"On information and belief, Musk has already or intends to have xAI harvest data from Tesla without appropriately compensating Tesla even though X has already been provided xAI equity for its data contributions. None of this would be necessary if Musk properly created xAI as a subsidiary of Tesla.\" We contacted Tesla today and will update this article if the company provides a response to the lawsuit. The filing of the complaint was previously reported by TechCrunch. Same court nullified Musk’s pay The Delaware Court of Chancery is the same one that nullified Elon Musk's 2018 pay package following a different investor lawsuit. Tesla shareholders yesterday re-approved the $44.9 billion pay plan, with 72 percent voting yes on the proposal, but the re-vote doesn't end the legal battle over Musk's pay. Tesla shareholders also approved a corporate move from Delaware to Texas, which was proposed by Musk and Tesla after the pay-plan court ruling. That drama factors into the lawsuit filed yesterday. After the pay ruling that effectively reduced Musk's stake in Tesla, \"Musk accelerated his efforts to grow xAI\" by \"raising billions of dollars and poaching at least eleven employees from Tesla,\" the new lawsuit said. The lawsuit also points to Musk's threat \"that he would only build an AI and robotics business within Tesla if Tesla gave him at least 25% voting power.\" The lawsuit accuses Tesla's board of \"permit[ting] Musk to create and grow xAI, hindering Tesla's AI development efforts and diverting billions of dollars in value from Tesla to xAI.\" The board's failure to act is alleged to be \"an obvious breach of its members' unyielding fiduciary duty to protect the interests of Tesla and its stockholders.\" The Tesla board members' close ties to Musk could play a key role in the case. In the pay-plan ruling, Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick found that most of Tesla's board members were beholden to Musk or had compromising conflicts. The lawsuit filed yesterday points to the court's previous findings on those board members, including Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother; and James Murdoch, a longtime friend of Musk.",

        "title": "Meet the Tesla board fighting for Elon Musk's $46 billion payday",
        "text": "Tesla is embroiled in another major controversy and its board of directors are at its center. This latest kerfuffle goes all the way back to the distant year of 2018, when Tesla’s board put together a surprising compensation package for CEO Elon Musk. The plan, which was approved by 73% of shareholders, gave Musk the right to purchase up to 304 million Tesla shares priced at $23.34 per unit, as long as he met a series of increasingly difficult milestones. Despite the difficulty of achieving the goals, Tesla met enough of them by the end of 2022 for Musk to receive the full package. But a Delaware judge in January struck down the deal in response to Richard J. Tornetta’s shareholder lawsuit, citing the “deeply flawed” process that led to its approval and calling it an “unfathomable sum” that was unfair to investors. The judge also called into question Musk’s relationships with the board’s directors and slammed some, including chair Robyn Denholm, for a failure to enforce proper oversight of the chief executive. On June 13, shareholders will vote on a series of proposals, including the re-ratification of Musk’s compensation deal, the reelection of two directors, and a proposal to reincorporate the company in Texas. Tesla’s legal team has said a vote ratifying Musk’s pay would materially affect proceedings in Delaware, where a judge is deciding how much to award to Tornetta’s legal team, Reuters reports. Now, meet the seven members of Tesla’s board who are overseeing Tesla’s future. Excluding, of course, the “Technoking” of Tesla, Elon Musk. Robyn Denholm Tesla board chairman Robyn Denholm came to Tesla from Australia, where she worked as an accountant, followed by seven years working for Toyota Motor Finance. She then moved on to stints working for computer gear manufacturer Sun Microsystems, which offered her a role in the U.S. Then, in 2007, Denholm moved to Juniper Networks, a California-based company selling networking products such as routers and software. After some time at Juniper, she was elevated to the role of chief financial officer. After being extended an offer from then-board member Brad Buss, Denholm joined Tesla’s board in 2014, becoming the first female director at the automaker. Denholm would stay at Juniper until August 2016 and return to Australia some months later to take over as chief operating officer for telecommunications firm Telstra. In October 2018, she was elevated to CFO and head of strategy of Telstra. Then just a month later she’d earn a second promotion: Denholm would be the one to take over as Tesla’s chair after Elon Musk was forced to step down as required by a settlement with U.S. regulators. She would later leave Telstra to dedicate more time to her duties at Tesla. As of 2021, Denholm is an operating partner at Blackbird, an Oceania-focused venture capital fund. Although Denholm has often been described as the “adult in the room,” she has been criticized for not properly reigning in Musk’s behavior. Delaware’s Judge Kathaleen McCormick wrote in January that her approach to enforcement of the 2018 settlement with regulators suggested a “lackadaisical approach to her oversight obligations.” James Murdoch Although not everyone may instantly known who James Murdoch is, they’re likely to recognize his father: ex-News Corp. CEO and Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch. The younger Murdoch got his start backing Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label, in 1995 after dropping out of Harvard University. He later joined News Corp. when it purchased the label in 1996. Over the next almost two decades, Murdoch’s experience would include stints leading News Corp’s Star Television, British Sky Broadcasting (which was minority owned by News Corp.) and News International. Murdoch faced a wave of personal scrutiny in the early 2010s after a newspaper owned by News International — News of The World — was caught engaging in phone hacking and bribery. In 2012, after a June 2008 email was discovered that linked him to the phone hacking, Murdoch resigned as chairman of News International and stepped down as chairman of British Sky Broadcasting, now known as Sky. Over the next few years, Murdoch would become the COO (and later CEO) of 21st Century Fox and — despite objections from shareholders — was briefly re-elected as Sky’s chairman. In 2020, Murdoch left News Corp. and accused the company of spreading disinformation through Fox News and other outlets. But his relationship with Elon Musk goes back to before almost all of that. Murdoch has testified in court that he has been close with Musk since 2006, 13 years before he was approached to join Tesla’s board by ex-board member Antonio Gracias. Mudorch has described vacationing with Musk and their families in the Caribbean, Jerusalem, and Mexico. Murdoch is also one of the two board members up for re-election on June 13. Several investors and activists, including Tesla’s largest retail shareholder, have said they will vote against his reinstatement. Kimbal Musk Besides his obvious brotherly ties to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk is an ongoing business partner. Kimbal, the middle-child of the Musk family, worked with Elon on Zip2, an online city guide that was sold in 1999 for more than $300 million, and invested in Musk’s original X.com (which later merged with Paypal). He was also one of the original board members of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and an entrepenur in his own right; his Kitchen Restaurant Group owns a collection of restaurants in Chicago and Colorado, while his Big Green nonprofit has built hundreds of outdoor classrooms across the U.S. However, Musk — like his brother — has gotten into his fair share of controversies. In 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic began, his Next Door restaurant chain closed down some restaurants and changed its “Family Fund” program in a way that surprised and angered employees. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has also investigated whether the Musks violated insider-trading rules after Kimbal sold $108 million worth of Tesla shares a day before Elon asked Twitter users if he should sell 10% of his stock. Kimbal Musk has also reportedly consumed drugs and frequently attends parties with his brother, The Wall Street Journal reported in February. The Journal reports that people familiar with the parties have said Musk and his board members’ drug use has become concerning. Musk is also one of the two board members up for re-election on June 13. Several investors and activists, including Tesla’s largest retail shareholder, have said they will vote against his reinstatement. JB Straubel Besides Musk himself, few people have been at Tesla longer than co-founder JB Straubel, who was the fifth employee hired by the company in 2004. At Tesla, Straubel spent 14 years as the company’s chief technology officer and has been credited with designing Tesla’s battery cells. He also led the construction and concept of Tesla’s gigafactory in Nevada, the production of the Model 3 electric compact, and lobbied hard for Tesla to focus on Superchargers. Straubel also served on the board of SolarCity before it was acquired by Tesla in November 2016. The company was founded by Peter and Lyndon Rive, Elon Musk’s cousins. He left Tesla in 2019, as concerns mounted over the gap between consumer demand for electric vehicles and the resources needed to produce the requisite batteries. When Musk announced Straubel’s departure, he also announced a major quarterly loss that sunk the stock. Now, Straubel leads Redwood Materials, the biggest lithium-ion battery recycler in North America; the company has also branched into other markets in recent years and sells some two dozen products. In May 2023, Straubel joined Tesla’s board to the delight of shareholders, some of which speculated that he may take over as CEO in the future. Kathleen Wilson-Thompson Kathleen Wilson-Thompson joined Tesla’s board in 2018 after decades of working for retailers and construction companies. For more than 18 years, Wilson-Thompson worked for the Kellog Co. in a variety of positions, beginning as a corporate attorney and working her way up to leading global human resources before her 2010 departure. She then moved to overseeing human resources at Walgreens, followed by work at its parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance. Wilson-Thompson has also served on the board of construction company Vulcan Materials, chemical manufacturer Ashland, and health care company McKesson. She also serves on the board for the alumni association of her alma mater, Michigan University, and the NAACP Foundation. Wilson-Thompson is the sole member of Tesla’s special committee, which was charged with determining whether Tesla should reincorporate outside of Delaware and whether Elon Musk’s 2018 compensation package should be ratified at the same time as a shareholder vote on reincorporation. Her report argued that ratifying the pay package is a better option than negotiating a new one and that, given the interest in the topics, both votes should occur together. Negotiating a replacement compensation plan that Musk would agree with would take “substantial time” and “incur a new accounting charge of billions of dollars,” the report argued. “Ratification would be faster, would avoid any new compensation expense, and would avoid a prolonged period of uncertainty regarding Tesla’s most important employee,” the report said. Ira Ehrenpreis Ira Ehrenpreis is a familiar face to many at Tesla — and in Silicon Valley —having served on a series of industry boards. He’s also the president of the Western Association of Venture Capitalists and the Chairman of the VCNetwork, the largest Californian venture capital organization. Ehrenpreis is a founder and managing partner at DBL Partners, a venture capital firm that manages more than $1 billion. Besides being a close friend of Elon Musk’s, Ehrenpreis has invested about $70 million in his companies, and has served on the board of SpaceX. He’s served on Tesla’s board since 2007 and led the development of Musk’s 2018 compensation plan, which he has testified featured “extraordinarily ambitious and difficult” complications and was devised to keep the Tesla CEO around and active at Tesla. Joe Gebbia Although Joe Gebbia has been on Tesla’s board since 2022, most people would probably recognize him for his work with another company: Airbnb. In 2008, Gebbia — alongside Brian Chesky and Nathan Blecharczyk — founded the short-term housing rental company that has dominated the vacation rental market for years. In July 2022, Gebbia stepped back from the day-to-day operations at Airbnb, although he remains on its board and chairs its nonprofit arm. He also serves on the leadership councils for the Malala fund and the United Nations’ agency dedicated to helping refugees. Gebbia is a minority owner of the San Antonio Spurs and leads Samara, which sells factory-made prefabricated housing units to homeowners with extra space. The company’s initial range of what the industry calls accessory dwelling units, Backyard, start at $299,000 for 430-square-foot studios. In September 2022, Gebbia joined Tesla’s board, where he serves on its audit committee. His relationship with Elon Musk dates as far back as 2018, according to Bloomberg News, after Gebbia praised his attempt to take Tesla private at $420 per share. That bid later got Musk in a heap of trouble with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",

        "title": "Elon Musk’s $46 billion payday will be decided by Tesla investors next month. Here’s what to know",
        "text": "In just a few weeks, Tesla shareholders will be able to decide the future of the world’s largest electric vehicle company. Investors — both large and small — will come together on June 13 for Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, where anyone with stock in the company can vote on a series of ballot measures. Although many of the 3.1. billion shares — and votes attached to them — will likely be cast days, if not weeks, before that day. The meeting will open up Tesla to a number of operational changes and, most importantly, serve as somewhat of a referendum of Elon Musk, the controversial billionaire who has served as CEO since 2008. In the weeks leading up to the vote, advisory firms and investors alike have issued warnings both for and against Musk, who is asking shareholders to re-approve his multibillion-dollar compensation package. A vote for Musk would embolden the CEO, who is known for his boastful promises, and grant him more control of the company. A vote against him would be an irritation and an about-face of shareholders’ prior widely-held opinions. Here’s what’s on the table. A $46 billion reason to vote The biggest issue on the table, by far, is whether Elon Musk will get his compensation package reapproved by shareholders. June’s meeting will be the second time that investors have voted on the compensation deal, which was approved in 2018 and tied Musk’s pay directly to Tesla’s performance. However, a shareholder lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court successfully got the deal struck down by Judge Kathaleen McCormick in January (more on why later). The 2018 CEO compensation plan, the largest in history, was valued at up to $55.8 billion dollars and was the largest executive compensation package in recent history. Seventy-three percent of investors supported the plan at the time. It’s now valued at a smaller, but still substantial, $46 billion. Some, including proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, have argued that shareholders should vote against the plan, citing its “excessive size.” They also argue that Musk’s attention has been split among his portfolio — which now stands at seven companies thanks to the birth of xAI last year — and that the plan could dilute investors’ existing holdings in Tesla. Musk in April addressed similar concerns during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call, telling analysts that Tesla “constitutes a majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week; it’s rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.” Tesla argues that the plan was valid and that Musk has not been paid for “any of his work” for the Austin, Texas-based company since 2018. Since the end of 2018, Tesla has added roughly $500 billion in market value. The company has gone to great lengths to win over shareholders, purchasing advertisements and launching a dedicated website, while non-affiliated backers are posting online videos and reaching out to “swing voters” for one-on-one discussions. Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm has been reaching out to larger institutional investors to secure support. A common theme among supporters of the pay package is that Tesla shareholders already approved the deal in 2018 and that judges should respect their decision. Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which owns 3 million shares and voted in favor of the deal six years ago, recently reaffirmed its support on similar grounds. A Musk-sized problem On the off chance that shareholders reject Musk’s compensation, it’s entirely possible he may leave the company. In the past, he’s expressed discomfort with advancing some of Tesla’s goals without owning a larger percentage of the company, which the deal is poised to do. “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control,” Musk said on his social media platform X on Jan. 15. “Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned. Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” That could be a big problem. Tesla — led by Musk’s ambitions — is going “balls to the wall” on developing self-driving vehicles and working toward mass-deployment of its humanoid robots, Optimus. Even as federal investigations continue to examine Tesla’s driver assistance software, Musk has committed to unveiling a self-driving car on Aug. 8. Musk’s comments about ownership also worried some investors who were already concerned about succession plans at Tesla. Several potential replacements have left the company in recent years, including former “master of coin” and CFO Zachary Kirkhorn, who many had seen as the obvious successor. Another potential successor was Andrew Baglino, the senior vice president in charge of energy engineering and powertrain. Baglino resigned last month and pocketed a cool $181.5 million on his way out. A direct(or) issue Investors will also be voting on the re-election of two men crucial to Musk’s success to the company’s board of directors: Kimbal Musk, his brother, and James Murdoch, a long-time friend. Many members of the board have a mixture of close personal, familial, or transactional ties to the CEO. They’ve also been criticized of not doing enough to reign in Musk and enforce proper oversight. Richard J. Tornetta, the shareholder who filed the lawsuit that killed Musk’s compensation package, argued in court that Musk had used his influence on the board to secure the plan and the funds would go to support his dreams of colonizing Mars. McCormick, the Delaware judge, wrote that the “process leading to the approval of Musk’s compensation plan was deeply flawed,” noting that he “operates as if free of Board oversight” and cited Musk’s “extensive ties” to members of the board. She also described Denholm’s approach to her oversight obligations as “lackadaisical.” The Wall Street Journal in February published a sweeping look at Musk’s relationships with members of the board, including how several members — including Murdoch and Kimbal Musk — have invested tens of millions of dollars in each others’ companies. Kimbal Musk, board member and Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, and multiple former board members have also consumed drugs like ketamine with the CEO, the Journal reported. “The Board stands behind this pay package. We believed in it in 2018, as we asked Elon to pursue remarkable goals to grow the company,” Denholm said in a letter to shareholders. “We do not agree with what the Delaware Court decided, and we do not think that what the Delaware Court said is how corporate law should or does work.” What else is on the ballot? But Musk’s promised pay and who gets to sit on Tesla’s board are just two of 12 total proposals for shareholder consideration next month. Investors will also cast their ballots in favor for or against the board’s push to reincorporate the company in Texas, a process Musk set in motion shortly after McCormick voted down his compensation deal in January. “Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas,” he wrote at the time. SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace giant, has already made the move to ditch Delaware and relocate to Texas. If the move is approved, Tesla will join SpaceX and exit a state with a two-century-old corporate legal system. Texas, last June, approved the “Business Courts,” which won’t officially open until September and lack Delaware’s reliable and balanced corporate law. Tesla has also proposed appointing an independent accounting firm and compensation for executives like automotive senior vice president Tom Zhu. The company has asked shareholders to vote in favor of all five of its proposals, which also includes the appointment of Kimbal Musk and Murdoch, as well as Musk’s compensation. Also on the ballot are measures submitted by shareholders that propose restricting directors to one-year term limits; requiring a simple majority for votes instead of the current supermajority needed for approval; freezing sourcing materials from deep sea mining; and adopting a collective bargaining contract. Shareholders also proposed a series of initiatives that would require Tesla to provide more transparency. If approved, those proposals would force Tesla to provide annual repots on anti-harassment and discrimination efforts; information concerning the risks associated with wireless technologies and electromagnetic radiation; and adopt and report the feasibility of integrating sustainability metrics into compensation for executives. Tesla has asked investors to vote against each of the seven shareholder-submitted proposals. A financial fiasco The shareholder debacle comes after months of issues for the company that culminated in staggered layoffs that affected thousands of employees. Tesla delivered just 386,810 EVs over the first three months of 2024, well below Wall Street’s expectations, shocking investors. The company, Musk has said, is “currently between two major growth waves” and streamlining its operations. In April, Tesla began laying off “more than 10%” of its global workforce, or at least 14,000 people. The company continued laying off workers for about a month across its global operations. More than 20,000 people may have been laid off in Tesla’s first round of headcount reductions, Bloomberg reported last month. Summer internship offers have been revoked just weeks before their start dates. Almost the entire Supercharger division has been cut, despite Tesla being a major player in the EV charging industry, although several members have been re-hired. Meanwhile, Tesla’s public policy team has been greatly reduced and the marketing division axed. At least six high-profile executives have either already resigned or plan to later this year, including head of investor relations Martin Viecha and senior director of human resources for North America Allie Arebalo. And, as Tesla’s sales in China have slowed, Musk has directed Tesla’s “fireman” — automotive senior vice president Tom Zhu — to return to his old job overseeing the country’s market. Zhu has been credited with turning Tesla’s Gigafactory Shanghai into a major performer. Tesla sold 62,167 China-made cars in April, down 18% compared to the same time in 2023, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association earlier this month. Production of the Model Y — one of two cars made in Shanghai — has been slashed in recent months.",

        "title": "Elon Musk wins back his huge Tesla payday in shareholder vote",
        "text": "DETROIT (AP) — Tesla shareholders on Thursday voted to restore CEO Elon Musk’s record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year. Vote totals were not immediately announced. The favorable vote doesn’t mean CEO Musk will get the all-stock compensation anytime soon. The package is likely to remain tied up in the Delaware Chancery Court for months as Tesla appeals the rejection. The court ruled in January that Musk essentially controlled the Tesla board when it approved the package in 2018, and that it failed to fully inform shareholders who approved it the same year. Tesla has said it would appeal, but asked shareholders to reapprove the package at Thursday’s the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. Tesla shareholders are charting the future of the electric vehicle company Thursday as they wrap up voting whether or not to restore CEO Elon Musk’s massive pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge. Shares of the company rose Thursday after Tesla said in a regulatory filing that stockholders are voting to approve Musk’s pay, valued around $44.9 billion, by a wide margin. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, Tesla published Musk’s own posts late Wednesday on X, the social media platform he owns, with charts that appeared to show that shareholders were in favor of his compensation package, as well a measure to move Tesla’s legal home from Delaware to Texas. The company sought the votes after a Delaware judge threw out the pay package in January. Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick determined that Tesla deceived shareholders when the all stock compensation was approved in 2018, so Musk is not entitled to the landmark package, which was worth nearly $56 billion before a stock slide this year. Legal experts say that releasing vote totals while balloting is in progress could present problems for Tesla, and that may be why the company made the filing with the SEC, which is likely to look into the matter. Shareholders can still cast votes online Thursday and in person Thursday afternoon at Tesla’s annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas. They also can change previously cast votes. “Anytime you tell people you’re winning, you’re encouraging others to join you and those who oppose you to pull back,” said Charles Elson, a retired professor and founder of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware. Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan, said Musk’s posts could draw legal scrutiny. “His post had better be accurate or else anyone who bought stock relying on it will have a securities law case against him,” Gordon said in an email. The SEC declined comment Thursday, and a message was left seeking comment from Tesla. Elson said posting corporate proxy vote totals before the balloting ends is “highly unusual.” Social media posts by Musk have drawn scrutiny from the SEC before. He and Tesla were fined a total of $40 million for statements about funding to make Tesla a private company that Musk made on X’s predecessor, Twitter, before he bought the social media platform. Shares of Tesla closed Thursday up just under 3% at $182.47. The stock is down about 25% this year. If the pay package is approved, it would almost guarantee that Musk would remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles, shifting to AI and robotics including autonomous vehicles, which Musk says is Tesla’s future. But if shareholders were to vote against his pay, the CEO could deliver on threats to take artificial intelligence research to one of his other companies. Or he could even walk away from Tesla. Even with approval, there would be uncertainty. Musk has threatened on X to develop AI elsewhere if he doesn’t get a 25% stake in Tesla (He owns about 13% now). Musk’s xAI recently received $6 billion in funding to develop artificial intelligence. According to Musk, early indications suggest that shareholders also back a move to relocate Tesla’s legal home to Texas, and out of Delaware. The move is designed to escape from the Delaware court’s oversight and possibly from McCormick’s ruling. In a January opinion on a shareholder lawsuit, the judge determined that Musk controlled the Tesla board and is not entitled to the landmark pay package. Multiple institutional investors have come out against that sizeable payout, some citing falling vehicle sales, price cuts and the tumbling Tesla stock price. But Tesla’s top five institutional shareholders, Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Geode Capital, and Capital Research either said they don’t announce their votes or wouldn’t comment. They control about 17% of the votes. One institutional investor who came out against the package is California’s State Teachers Retirement System. The large pension fund said Tuesday that it would vote against Musk’s pay “based on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company.” In May, two big shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended voting against the package. But Tesla and Musk have unleashed a furious lobbying effort to get the package approved, in posts on X, television appearances and in proxy filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, in a letter to shareholders, wrote that the package was approved by 73% of the vote six years ago. “Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value. That strikes us — and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard — as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it,” she wrote. Tesla has said the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over $735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved. If Tesla finalizes the vote on moving the company’s legal home to Texas before the vote on Musk’s pay package, and it manages to file the paperwork in Austin and get approval of the move, then the effect of the Delaware court ruling could be in doubt. Reapproval of the pay package would then be done as a Texas corporation and could fall under the purview of Texas courts. Anticipating a quick move by Tesla, lawyers for the shareholder who filed the lawsuit seeking to block Musk’s pay deal, Richard Tornetta, filed motions in Delaware last month seeking an order stopping Tesla from trying to move the case. Tesla responded in letters to the judge that there is no cause for such concerns because they won’t seek a move. Besides, Tesla would still be a Delaware corporation at the time of this week’s shareholder vote, they wrote. In an order denying Tornetta’s motions, Chancellor McCormick wrote that she interprets Tesla’s letters to mean it has no intention of relocating the case to Texas. “The defendants’ statements give me great comfort,” she wrote. Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, said he expects Tesla to follow through with appealing McCormick’s ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "title": "Tesla HQ had several 'terroristic threat' reports since opening",
        "text": "In recent months, \"two homicidal maniacs\" have threatened to kill Elon Musk, the billionaire tech mogul said at Tesla's latest annual shareholder meeting.\"I probably need to like work out and, you know, and like not get assassinated or something,\" the CEO of the electric-car company told shareholders June 13 in response to a question about what he's doing to keep himself safe and healthy.Musk said the two people \"aspirationally\" tried to kill him and \"a bunch of other people\" in the past seven months, forcing him to be a bit more \"standoffish.\"Security is a high priority for Musk. He owns his own security company, which Tesla pays millions of dollars to protect Musk, a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows.Tesla has relatively tight security, and the company increased security at some of its factories during its recent wave of layoffs, several workers told Business Insider. Tesla factory workers have also faced their fair share of scares over the years, including, most recently, an active-shooter report that turned out to be a false alarm.Law-enforcement records obtained by BI through a public-records request show that Musk has not been the only high-profile target of threats or intimidation at Tesla's sprawling corporate headquarters in Austin.In March 2023, Tesla's chief financial officer at the time, Zachary Kirkhorn — who board members considered making Musk's successor before he unexpectedly resigned — received a death threat via email, according to 911 records and a sheriff's office incident report viewed by BI. The missive demanded $300,000 in bitcoin not to end his life.The Travis County Sheriff's Office described the incident as a \"terroristic threat\" in its report, the documents show, though ultimately law enforcement believed it to be a scam.Under Texas law, terroristic threats include threats of violence that are intended to put people in fear of imminent bodily injury, cause a reaction by an emergency agency, or interrupt a place of employment.Other records from the sheriff's office obtained by BI show that at least five other 911 calls were made from Tesla's HQ between the opening of the Austin Gigafactory in April 2022 and January of this year for what law enforcement also categorized as terroristic threats. The sheriff's office is seeking to withhold the records for most of those incidents from BI.In the case of Kirkhorn, a Tesla security officer at the Gigafactory initially called 911 at the time to report the incident, according to the records. The security officer told deputies that the CFO had gotten an email from someone claiming to have been \"hired to kill you if you don't step down,\" the report provided to BI said.\"Wire $300,000 dollars to bitcoin account within 12 hours,\" the email to Kirkhorn added, according to the incident report.The Tesla security officer told deputies the email was sent to multiple email addresses with variations of Kirkhorn's name, suggesting that the sender was attempting to guess his email address.The security officer also said he believed it was the \"first threat\" that Kirkhorn received by email, according to the report.In a second interview with deputies, the security officer told authorities his team was able to trace information in the threatening email back to Nigeria.A Travis County Sheriff's Office spokesperson, Kristen Dark, confirmed to BI that the email was found to have originated from Nigeria and was thought to be spam.\"Based on the spam email mail address it is likely a scam attempt,\" the incident report read. \"This was brought to Kirkhorn's attention and he was ok with just documenting the situation. No further action needed.\"The case was ultimately suspended and no arrest was ever made, according to the incident report and Dark.Tesla and Kirkhorn did not respond to requests for comment.Kirkhorn left Tesla last August after working at the carmaker for about 13 years. He held the title not only of CFO, but also \"Master of Coin.\"His departure came as a shock to some. The Wall Street Journal had reported earlier that year that Kirkhorn could be in line to become the next CEO of Tesla.One of the other 911 calls that the sheriff's office designated as a \"terroristic threat\" related to a report by a Tesla employee who said he was threatened in February 2023 by another worker while on the job. The suspect in that case was accused of threatening to pull the man off a forklift and \"slap the shit\" out of him, according to an incident report.The employee who made the report told deputies that he had been \"advised to allow Tesla Security to work the incident first before attempting to file a police report\" but that he got \"tired of waiting on Tesla,\" the documents show.The case was closed after the accuser told deputies he no longer wished to pursue it, but he sought to get it reopened that July.Some Tesla workers told BI that tight production deadlines and the intensity of the work could sometimes create a high-pressure environment.\"Every time they ramped up production, I felt like a frog in a boiling pot of water,\" one former worker from the Austin factory said. \"You could just feel the stress level at the factory shoot up, and sometimes that meant people were more likely to pop off or act out.\"Another 911 call that was made in January of this year and categorized as a terroristic threat related to a report of a Tesla employee threatening to kill Musk and US President Joe Biden. Travis County deputies responded to Tesla HQ at the time of the call.A day later, Justin Mathew McCauley of Minnesota was arrested on a felony charge of terroristic threat in connection to the incident. According to an arrest affidavit obtained by BI, security at Tesla alerted the Travis County Sheriff's Office of a threat made on McCauley's account on X, the social-media site owned by Musk.\"I will arrive in Texas, where the war has began on many fronts @X, @Tesla,\" one post said, according to the court documents. Another said, \"@JoeBiden @X @Tesla @Elonmusk, I am planning to Kill all of you.\"According to the court papers, McCauley's wife notified deputies in Minnesota after he told her he was going to Texas and never coming back.McCauley was eventually stopped and arrested by Travis County deputies in Austin on January 28. He told them that he planned to go to the Gigafactory \"to try and contact Elon Musk,\" the arrest affidavit says.\"Everything I did was completely insane. It seems like a bad dream,\" McCauley later told FOX 7 Austin in an on-camera interview. The 32-year-old former Tesla worker said he was in a state of \"psychosis.\"McCauley was jailed for roughly four weeks before he was released on bond March 1. His next court hearing in the case is scheduled for July 3. Attempts to reach McCauley on Monday and Tuesday were unsuccessful.The details surrounding the other three 911 calls from Tesla's headquarters — which records show were made in November 2022, March 2023, and November 2023 — and the dispositions of those calls, were not provided to BI. The sheriff's office said in a letter sent to BI that the records fell under privacy and open-investigation exemptions to the public-records law and has asked the Office of the Attorney General of Texas to weigh in.Dark, the Travis County Sheriff's Office spokesperson, told BI that the agency did not provide additional security services for the Tesla factory but would respond to emergencies there as it would any other location in the county.\"The Gigafactory is in our agency's jurisdiction and we respond to 911 calls for service,\" Dark said.Last July, the Travis County Sheriff's Office responded to a 911 call reporting an active shooter at the Austin Gigafactory. At the time, workers who were at the factory received a memo from Tesla telling them to take cover because of an \"Active Attacker,\" two employees told BI.\"It was unsettling because no one really knew what was going on. We were just standing outside the building waiting to go back to work,\" one worker, who was there during the ordeal, told BI. The employee asked that they not be identified in this story, as they are not authorized to speak to the press, but BI has verified their employment.The sheriff's office told local news at the time that the building was cleared and there was \"nothing to substantiate the presence of a shooter at all.\"The false alarm wasn't the first scare at a Tesla factory.In 2021, a Tesla worker was fatally shot in the parking lot of the company's Fremont, California, factory after an altercation with a coworker who was later charged with murder.In April, Tesla appeared to tighten security at some of its factories after Musk told the staff he planned to eliminate more than 10% of the workforce.The day after the memo was sent out, some staff at Tesla's factory in Sparks, Nevada, waited in hours-long lines to get through a series of badge checks, and some workers found out they'd been laid off after security scanned their badges and sent them back home on shuttle buses, five current and former employees previously told BI.Several Tesla workers told BI it would be difficult for anyone to bring in a weapon or unauthorized personnel to access the company's factories.Factory workers in both Nevada and Texas go through at least three security checkpoints to enter their workplace, with badge checks on the shuttles in, and at the gate for those who drive into work, as well as at two separate points once they enter the building, four workers said.Musk has expressed concern about his personal safety multiple times over the years and even talked about dying \"under mysterious circumstances.\"The billionaire has also repeatedly attempted to take down a social-media account that tracked his private jet travels, even threatening to sue the college student who ran the account after Musk said his son X had been followed by a \"crazy stalker\" because of the jet-tracking account.BI previously reported that Musk secretly bought a house in 2022 after the address of a house he'd been renting became public knowledge and Musk found it to be \"no longer private and secure for my family.\" A neighbor told BI earlier this year that the home had around-the-clock security.From December 2023 to February, Tesla shelled out about $3 million to Musk's security company, which represented only \"a portion of the total cost of security services concerning Elon Musk,\" according to an SEC filing.Security costs can include measures as varied as personal bodyguards or private planes, and Musk is one of many prominent executives spending millions over security concerns.In 2023, Meta approved a $14 million security allowance for its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. The company spent over $24 million on expenses associated with Zuckerberg, including security and private travel, an SEC filing shows.Meta said in the filing that Zuckerberg had become \"one of the most recognized executives in the world\" and needed to be protected as a result. The company's longtime chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg was also given a security budget.Tesla and Musk's other companies seem to have taken a similar approach. Last year, an engineer at Twitter, the social-media site that became known as X, told the BBC that Musk was followed around the company's headquarters by at least two bodyguards at all times.\"It is getting a little crazy these days,\" Musk said at the June 13 Tesla shareholder meeting. \"To first approximation, the probability that a homicidal maniac will try to kill you is proportionate to how many homicidal maniacs hear your name.\"\"So they hear my name a lot — I'm like, OK, I'm on the list, you know,\" Musk said, laughing.\"Think of John Lennon who was singing about, 'Hey, can't we all just be nice to each other,' and then he got shot by one of his fans,\" Musk said. \"Like, OK, we'll try to avoid that.\"",

        "text": "By TOM KRISHER (AP Auto Writer) DETROIT (AP) — Tesla shareholders are charting the future of the electric vehicle company Thursday as they wrap up voting whether or not to restore CEO Elon Musk’s massive pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge. Shares of the company jumped at the opening bell Thursday after the company said in a regulatory filing that stockholders are voting to approve Musk’s pay, valued around $44.9 billion, by a wide margin.

Shares of Tesla shot up nearly 7% to $189.20 in trading before Thursday’s opening bell. The stock is down about 30% this year. If the pay package is approved, it would almost guarantee that Musk would remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles, shifting to AI and robotics including autonomous vehicles, which Musk says is Tesla’s future. But if shareholders were to vote against his pay, the CEO could deliver on threats to take artificial intelligence research to one of his other companies. Or he could even walk away from Tesla. Even with approval, there would be uncertainty. Musk has threatened on X to develop AI elsewhere if he doesn’t get a 25% stake in Tesla (He owns about 13% now). Musk’s xAI recently received $6 billion in funding to develop artificial intelligence. According to Musk, early indications suggest that shareholders also back a move to relocate Tesla’s legal home to Texas, and out of Delaware. The move is designed to escape from the Delaware court’s oversight and possibly from McCormick’s ruling. In a January opinion on a shareholder lawsuit, the judge determined that Musk controlled the Tesla board and is not entitled to the landmark pay package. Multiple institutional investors have come out against that sizeable payout, some citing falling vehicle sales, price cuts and the tumbling Tesla stock price. But Tesla’s top five institutional shareholders, Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Geode Capital, and Capital Research either said they don’t announce their votes or wouldn’t comment. They control about 17% of the votes. One institutional investor who came out against the package is California’s State Teachers Retirement System. The large pension fund said Tuesday that it would vote against Musk’s pay “based on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company.” In May, two big shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended voting against the package. But Tesla and Musk have unleashed a furious lobbying effort to get the package approved, in posts on X, television appearances and in proxy filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, in a letter to shareholders, wrote that the package was approved by 73% of the vote six years ago. “Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value. That strikes us — and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard — as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it,” she wrote. Tesla has said the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over $735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved. If Tesla finalizes the vote on moving the company’s legal home to Texas before the vote on Musk’s pay package, and it manages to file the paperwork in Austin and get approval of the move, then the effect of the Delaware court ruling could be in doubt. Reapproval of the pay package would then be done as a Texas corporation and could fall under the purview of Texas courts. Anticipating a quick move by Tesla, lawyers for the shareholder who filed the lawsuit seeking to block Musk’s pay deal, Richard Tornetta, filed motions in Delaware last month seeking an order stopping Tesla from trying to move the case. Tesla responded in letters to the judge that there is no cause for such concerns because they won’t seek a move. Besides, Tesla would still be a Delaware corporation at the time of this week’s shareholder vote, they wrote. In an order denying Tornetta’s motions, Chancellor McCormick wrote that she interprets Tesla’s letters to mean it has no intention of relocating the case to Texas. “The defendants’ statements give me great comfort,” she wrote. Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, said the lawyers are unlikely to try to move the case because their livelihood is handling business cases in Delaware courts. But it’s also possible that the unpredictable Musk could change lawyers. McCormick, Talley said, is telling the lawyers “OK, I’m going to believe you, but I’m going to be really irritated if this is a big send up for these things that you said you’re not going to do.” Talley, who also is a Tesla shareholder and said at present he plans to vote against Musk’s pay, expects Tesla to follow through with appealing McCormick’s ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. Shares of Tesla Inc. rose more than 6% in early trading Thursday.",
        "summary": "Tesla shareholders are charting the future of the electric vehicle company Thursday as they wrap up voting whether or not to restore CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s massive pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge. Shares of the company spiked in premarket trading early Thursday after the company said in a regulatory filing that stockholders are approving Musk&#8217;s $44.9 billion pay package by a wide margin. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla published posts on X by Musk from Wednesday night of charts showing that his compensation package was passing, as was a measure to move Tesla&#8217;s legal home from Delaware to Texas.",
